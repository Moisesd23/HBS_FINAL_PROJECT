# HBS_FINAL_PROJECT

The HBS application is designed to simplify and streamline the payment and transfer process for bank customers. It would provide a user-friendly interface that addresses common difficulties experienced by older adults and those less familiar with digital banking technology. A little context about the name of this application is that whenever people talk about discovering a new horizon, they categorize it as something new and better, and for that reason, when customers discover HBS, they will know that it is a new horizon with better features than they have seen in the past in other applications.

Goals of the Application:
•	To make payments to other bank accounts as easy and straightforward as possible.
•	To speed up and simplify the process of transferring money to other accounts.
•	To introduce automatic internal transfers between accounts owned by the same client, 
•	To create a simple and clear user interface tailored to non-tech-savvy individuals.

Target Audience:
The primary audience for the HBS application includes:
•	Age Group: 45 to 75 years old
•	Gender: All genders
•	Socioeconomic Characteristics: The only requirement is that the user be a customer of the bank offering the application.
•	Technological Experience: The design will prioritize accessibility and clarity for users who may not be comfortable with digital interfaces.
